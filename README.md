# Travels

Here are two visualizations I have created, each featuring destinations I have visited and those I aspire to explore. I have developed two distinct versions of this visualization, with the primary distinction between Version 1 and Version 2 being the enhanced interactivity of Version 2â€™s map.

If you prefer to view these visualizations directly in your browser without downloading the files, I have attached the corresponding links with descriptive titles below.
